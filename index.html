            If I am completely honest, I am not much of an avid reader. I hardly ever read books but rather am much more interested in webcomics (if it wasn't already obvious from my previous lab submission).

            That being said, I recently started a webcomic about a woman who travels back in time to seek revenge on her enemies in the past. This kind of plot line is <i>very</i> common in webcomics yet I seem to enjoy it in all of its variations. I simply find the stories to be very satisfying to read.
